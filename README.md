## Unleash the Power of LangGraph with MCP: Math & Database Examples!

üöÄ Ready to take your LangGraph skills to the next level? In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into connecting LangGraph to external services using the powerful `langchain-mcp-adapter`!

We'll walk you through the best way to use MCP with two practical examples:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Math Server Integration:** Learn how to build a LangGraph that performs arithmetic operations by interacting with a custom math server through MCP. We'll show you how to define your API, create the MCP configuration, and seamlessly integrate it into your LangGraph workflow.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Neon Database Connection:** Discover how to connect LangGraph to a Neon database using MCP. We'll demonstrate how to query and manipulate data in your Neon DB directly from your LangGraph, opening up a world of possibilities for data-driven applications.

This repo covers:

* Understanding the `langchain-mcp-adapter` and its benefits.
* Setting up and configuring MCP for custom APIs and databases.
* Creating LangGraph flows that interact with external services.
* Practical examples with a math server and Neon DB.
* Step-by-step code walkthroughs and explanations.
